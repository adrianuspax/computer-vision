# Computer Vision
This is a collection of sample projects I'm using to get familiar with various open cv features. My goal is to better understand the current state of computer vision technology so that I can make informed and realistic design decisions.

## Open CV Unity
So far, this project incorporates the Open CV + Unity asset bundle (not included in this repo, available in the Unity Asset store). For the most part, my goal is to use the library to better integrate these featurs into unity projects. At this point, I'd like to develop an interface that exposes elements like object and face recognition. For example, right now the library detects a face. I'd like to access the coordinates of the face and expose that in a public variable that can be accessed by other components. 

**Key areas of interest:**
* Face Detection
* Face Recognition
* Object Recognition
* Marker detection
